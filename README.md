# Member-System
A member system for user to add general and VIP members, keep track of their points and rearrange their orders using different algorithms in different data structures.

# Why doing this in the first place?
I always have a great interest in the operation and management of cafe, restaurant, tea house or anything like these. A member system is a necessity. It can help 
managers and owners record general members and VIP members with all their basic information and their points. The most valued customer should be able to get some
reward in order to make them feel "good" and keep coming back to the place, keep consuming and in the best case scenario, recommend the place to others. So it is 
never too much to assume that a good member system is, at the very least, the "soul" of the place.
I learned some basic data structures and algorithms in college and thus had knowledge about time complexity. The two different kinds of members have a huge 
difference in their amount. General members have a much larger number than VIP members because it's free to get registered as a general member (there's no cost at all!)
So in this case, in order to sort and get access to a specific member in both kinds of members real quick, we need to store them in distinct data sturctures. I happened to learn some data structures with different features so I think this is a good way to put what I have learned from class into practice. Therefore, I create this system: a practice for me as a freshman majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science :)

# What to improve?
Definitely UI. Up until I created this project, I have only taken 2 cs courses in college. I have limited experience in python, java, basic data structures 
and algorithms. I know UI is the key of user experience, but I don't know how to create it. Right now I'm learning front-end stuffs (HTML, CSS and js) but does 
there even exist any connection between front-end and my java codes and if there is, how to connect them together? This is the thing that I always think about when
writing my code and hopefully in the near future, I can figure it out!

Just write these for fun, and for recording my progress as a math and cs undergrad XD
